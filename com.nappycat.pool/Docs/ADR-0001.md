# ADR-0001 — NappyCat Pool

## Status
Accepted — Zero-allocation pooling utilities for GameObjects and components (Nc hub-backed).

## Context
- Reduce allocations and GC pressure for frequently-created objects and GameObjects.
- Provide a small API surface that can be consumed directly or via the `Nc.Pool` hub.

## Decision
- Ship `NcPool<T>` and `NcGoPool` for simple pooling needs.
- Offer policy-driven `NcObjectPool<T>` plus `INcPoolPolicy<T>` for lifecycle hooks.
- Expose a hub helper (`Nc.Pool.Create`) for quick access without extra wiring.

## Consequences
- Simple adoption path: use hub helper or reference `NappyCat.Pool` directly.
- Users must still design reset/cleanup logic appropriate to their types.
