# Changelog — NappyCat Pool

All notable changes to this package are documented here.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased
- Initial scaffold generated by automation.
- Docs now reference the `NappyCat.Pool` namespace and the `Nc.Pool` hub helper.
- Added working quick-start sample (`PoolQuickStart`) and filled in edit/play mode smoke tests.
- `NcGoPool` now calls `NcPooledBehaviour` hooks on acquire/release.
- Removed unused `NcPoolPolicySO` stub (will reintroduce when a concrete policy asset is needed).
- Removed unused `INcPoolable` interface to reduce API surface.
