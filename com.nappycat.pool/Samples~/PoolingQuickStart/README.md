# Pooling Quick Start

This sample demonstrates how **NappyCat Pool** can be used for deterministic warmup and zero-allocation reuse.

## Overview

Demonstrates pooling of reusable projectiles with zero allocations after warmup.

## Instructions

1. Import the sample into your project.
2. Drop `PoolQuickStart` on an empty GameObject.
3. (Optional) Assign your own prefab; otherwise a cube is spawned.
4. Press Play and hit Space to spawn pooled instances; they recycle after a short delay.
